dotfiles
========

This repository contains all of the _dotfiles_ that I've configured and want to
both backup AND be able to easily transfer to a new machine (install).

Many thanks to Michael Smalley for his blog post [Using git and Github to manage your Dotfiles][manageDotfiles]

[manageDotfiles]: <http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/>

I've set the .gitignore to ignore ALL files, so that I can pick and choose which files are actually
added to the repository. I don't want config files w/ passwords or license keys in the clear to be
in this repository.
