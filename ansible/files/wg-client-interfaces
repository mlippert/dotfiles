# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)
# NOTE: use source instead of source-directory because source-directory
#       only includes files whose filenames consist of letters, numbers,
#       dashes and underscores. In particular NOT dots, so x.conf would
#       not be included.
# Include files from /etc/network/interfaces.d:
source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*
